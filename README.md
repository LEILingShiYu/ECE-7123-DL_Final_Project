## ECE-7123 Deep Learning Final Project
# Gerneral
This repository is for NYU 2025 Fall Deep Learning course(ECE-7123) Final Project.
The project is about implementing and comparing two lightweight neural network architectures—the ResNet-34 CNN and the Swin-Tiny Vision Transformer—for the task of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) on the NYU Depth V2 dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset for this competition is the [NYU-DEPTH-V2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sayakpaul/nyu_depth_v2). It includes video sequences from a variety of indoor scenes as recorded by both the RGB and Depth:

***image*** — RGB image.\
***depth_map*** — Depth map

# Environment & Device

The project use ***Google Colab*** environments at newest version.\
The model is trained on A100 GPU provided by colab.


# Instruction
Follow the [notebook](https://github.com/LEILingShiYu/ECE-7123-DL_Final_Project/tree/main/code) instruction to Train and evaluate and save the model checkpoint & submission file on test dataset
